# House-Price-Predictor

## Overview
The House Price Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on different factors as such in the dataset Ames Housing Dataset. It utilizes data preprocessing, and denotes difference between linear regression and decision trees while also allowing to underestand linear neural networks which are similar to linear regression mathematically

## DataSet used is [AMES HOUSING](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset)

## **Features**
- Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values  
- Label Encoding for Categorical Features  
- Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Linear neural network for Prediction  
- Visualizations for Data Analysis and Model Evaluation using $$R^2$$ score and MAE
---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`,`torch`
